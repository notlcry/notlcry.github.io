## Sulli, South Korean K-Pop Star and Actress, Is Found Dead
The actress, singer and former K-pop band member Sulli, 25, was found dead in her home Monday, the police said. Sulli’s manager found her while checking her home in Seongnam after she failed to answer phone calls, said an official from the Seongnam Sujeong Police Department.

Sulli was known for being relatively candid in an industry that   rewarded glossy conformity, said Jeff Benjamin, the K-pop columnist at Billboard. “She really was an outspoken star in an industry that probably would have rather had her stay quiet, ” he said.
Sulli, whose legal name was Choi Jin-ri, did some acting as a child before she was recruited  to join the girl group f(x) under SM Entertainment.

She formally left the group in 2015 to focus on other things, including acting. She appeared in several films, and this year she became a host of a Korean television show “The Night of Hate Comments.” It featured celebrity guests poking fun at their experiences with online criticism and cyberbullying.

Sulli returned to music to release a solo album, “Goblin, ” in June. The title song is about a person with dissociative disorder, which has also been called multiple personality disorder.

K-pop groups have grown in popularity over the past decade, transcending borders to spread in Europe, the Middle East and the Americas, helped in large part by social media platforms like Twitter, YouTube and Instagram.

Some fans of the artist suggested that critical comments online had affected her mental health.
